I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia with a particular interest in robust, performant, large scale systems. Currently I'm wrapping up my third year of undergraduate studies while working with UBC's Networking, Systems and Security lab on high performance inference with distributed TensorFlow deployments.

In my spare time, you're likely to find me taking long walks around beautiful Vancouver with my X-T20, applying maths to things that are probably [not entirely appropriate](/cost-children-motherhood/) to apply math to, or [picking up](https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8) [heavy things](https://youtu.be/iIvTeIvaghg).
