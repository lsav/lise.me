title: Two years and counting
---
Two years ago today, I made the decision to go to engineering school.

This has definitely been my most stressful semester so far, and these few days are the most stressful days. It's
worth taking a moment to remember that, 25 months ago, I didn't feel stressed, and I didn't feel like too much was
being expected of me. All I felt was the crushing knowledge that I was wasting my life.

So, I'm going to stop cursing my exams and machine problems (at least for the next few minutes) and remind myself 
that this is what I was looking for, that I've learned through experience that the worst life is not a hard life but 
an aimless one, and that the only regret I have about my choice was that I didn't make it sooner.
