title: Goodbye Wordpress, Hello Jekyll

A brief timeline of lisesavard.com:

* **2014**: Registered the domain on a whim because why not?
* **December 2015**: Realised that, oh right, I have a domain. Installed Wordpress with the vague idea that I was going to maybe
make it a real personal web site "someday."
* **July 13, 2016**: Realised that, oh right, I have a Wordpress site. Threw a nice theme on and wrote my first post.
* **July 14, 2016**: Checked Akismet. Wow, 7 different spam comments.
* **July 17, 2016**: Received my first email warning about brute force login attempts
* **After August 7th-ish**: Someone hits from Reddit after someone linked to my post about
[how expensive children are](/cost-children-motherhood/). Cool! But also, more spam comments, more emails from my webhost warning
me about malicious login attempts.

The idea of a static site appealed to me because of the simplicity. I mean, this is my 8th blog post. I have an
[about](/index.html) page, a [projects](/projects/) page, a blog [front page](/blog/), and additionally host a page that holds
[documentation](/verdi-gui/) for a program I wrote over the summer. That's 12 pages. I was probably taking advantage of maybe 5% of
Wordpress's features.

A few other appealing things about Jekyll: being a tinkerer at heart, I was always frustrated with how much Wordpress tried to
obfuscate everything and instead offer "easy" and "customizable" themes and plugins. But nothing beats code for customizability.
The point at which I started making child themes so I could go digging in the PHP without risking breaking everything at the next
update was the point at which I should have switched. (So that would have been on July 13th, then. Oh well, 7 weeks isn't bad
for procrastinating on making a new personal web site)
