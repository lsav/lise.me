title: "How to Get Your Tuition's Worth"
---
Something that has been on my mind a lot lately, as I make what seems to be an unending stream of payments to
UBC, is how much value I'm getting out of my education.

To put some firm numbers to it, I paid about $5000 to UBC in September -- and that was only for one semester.
As far as the formal education part goes, I don't think that's a terribly compelling deal
deal. True, I have some great professors and TAs, but frequently there are equally good or even better professors
**on Youtube**. If only they could give me UBC credits as well as teach me how to solve differential equations, I
would save so much.

Thankfully, that's not the only thing my school offers, so here is a non-exhaustive list of the things I feel
like I'm getting a fantastic deal on.

### 1. My student team

One of the first things I did when I started at UBC was join [Sailbot](https://ubcsailbot.org/) as a member of the
software team. I could say something here about how much I'm learning, how it's so cool to program an autonomous
sailboat, how I'll get to work with equipment I could never access on my own (e.g. lidars!),
how it's almost like getting real job experience with the amount of collaboration (both inter- and
intra-disciplinary) required, but... really, what more do you need other than "robot sailboat"?

### 2. The campus

Sometimes between classes if I don't have too much else to do, I take a walk around the campus. There are so many
beautiful places to walk -- the Nitobe Memorial Garden is a favourite, but even just walking up to the end of Main
Mall, where you can look out over the rose garden and see the mountains off in the distance. If I have more time and
feel like venturing out further, there are the ocean-side trails.

It may seem frivolous, but once you get out into "the real world," people pay out the nose for things like access to
the ocean or views of beautiful mountains.

### 3. The facilities

On top of my engineering courses, I also signed up for a machine shop course that, between now and December, will
give me 40 hours of training on our department's full battery of professional-grade machining equipement.

This is already pretty cool, but the sweetest part of this deal is that, after the course, I will have full,
unimpeded access to all of the equipment that I've been trained on, as well as the option to take a short, extra
module that will allow me to have access to the EngPhys project lab's water jet, laser cutter, and 3D printers.

Let me repeat that: access to water jets, laser cutters, and 3D printers for the next four years. And, of
course, continued access to the people that can help me use them in case I forget. Which brings me to #4:

### 4. The experts

Back when I was a literature student, I used to avoid my professors as though they were plague carriers -- they were
the big scary people who judged me and gave me good or bad marks, why on earth would I want to talk to them?

I am so glad I have gotten over that aversion, because professors are _awesome_. They're a group of intelligent,
highly trained, often well connected people who are obligated to at least _let_ you approach them. From them, I've
received private lectures on areas of physics I've never heard of, targetted career advice, feedback on
<a href="/wakeup/">personal project</a> design, and got to spent a summer as a research assistant.

***

This is not an exhaustive list -- I've left out lots of other things, like the weekly colloquiums all the physics
students get invited to, the on-campus seminars, networking events, and much more.

I wish I had known this when I started undergrad before -- I might have liked being a literature major better. But,
then agian, quitting literature freed me to pursue engineering and I really, really like engineering, so it looks like
things worked out.
