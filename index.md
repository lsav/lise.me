Currently finishing up my last year of Computer Engineering. Also interested in economics, math, psychology, taking pretty pictures, and climbing (sometimes with ropes, sometimes trekking poles).

Very occasionally, I get the itch to write long-form blog-post type things. This is where I put those.
