I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia, currently entering my fourth (though not necessarily final) year. Aside from my own courses, I'll be a TA for [CPSC 320: Intermediate Algorithms](https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc3202017w1/) this year.

Previously, I was working at [A Thinking Ape Entertainment](http://www.athinkingape.com/) as a Software Development Engineer Intern on the [Kingdoms of Heckfire](http://kingdomsofheckfire.com/) team, doing game client optimization as well as end-to-end feature development.

My interests are fairly broad -- I really enjoy having to work within constraints and producing optimally performant and robust software with minimal resources. Specific areas of interest include distributed and scalable systems, systems-level software. I particularly enjoy getting to apply the scientific method to my work, testing and verifying assumptions as I go along in order to be certain of producing the best result.

More casually, I enjoy learning about behavioral economics and game theory and finding ways to apply them on an individual scale. Basically I just sometimes really wish that I, too, were a computer that could be optimized.

Oh, and I like to [pick up](https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8) [heavy things](https://youtu.be/iIvTeIvaghg).
