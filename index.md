Hi! I'm Lise, a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia.

Why Computer Engineering? I love the ability of computers to enhance individual creativity and solve problems. In my spare time, I enjoy applying the things I'm learning to improve the world around me: solving the problem of having to [wake up before dawn](https://youtu.be/MBOkNSHl62o), needing to keep [many versions of a single document](https://github.com/lsav/one-resume) in sync, or helping my coworkers operate a [class 4 laser more safely](https://youtu.be/ZaWmGg7Yhww).

This summer, I'll be working at [A Thinking Ape Entertainment](http://www.athinkingape.com/) as a Software Development Intern on the data analytics team, where I'm building predictive models to help inform A Thinking Ape's growth strategy. My previous co-op was at [Copperleaf Technologies](https://www.copperleaf.com/), where I implemented back end features for their software.

I also enjoy [picking up](https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8) [heavy things](https://youtu.be/iIvTeIvaghg).
