I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia, graduating in May 2020.

This past summer, I was an intern at [A Thinking Ape Entertainment](http://www.athinkingape.com/) as a Software Development Engineer Intern on the [Kingdoms of Heckfire](http://kingdomsofheckfire.com/) team, doing game client optimization and end-to-end feature development.

My interests are broad: I like writing code and making thing better, faster, and more reliable. If that sounds too vague, I've generally enjoyed working lower down in the software stack.

More casually, I enjoy learning about behavioral economics and game theory and finding ways to apply them on an individual scale. Basically I just sometimes really wish that I, too, were a computer that could be optimized.

In my spare time, I [take photos](https://unsplash.com/@rampallion) and [pick up](https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8) [heavy things](https://youtu.be/iIvTeIvaghg).
