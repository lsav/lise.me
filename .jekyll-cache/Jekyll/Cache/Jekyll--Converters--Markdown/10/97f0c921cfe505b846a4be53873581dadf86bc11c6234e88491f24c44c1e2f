<p>My supervisor, <a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/alireza-nojeh">Dr. Alireza Nojeh</a>, is the organizer for this year‚Äôs
<a href="http://www.vacuumnanoelectronics.org/">International Vacuum Nanoelectronics Conference</a>, and so of
course, I and the <a href="http://nanostructure.ece.ubc.ca/people/">other 7 members</a> of the Nojeh lab have, ahem, ‚Äúvolunteered‚Äù to staff
the conference.</p>

<p>Oh, did that sound like I was unhappy? Not at all! It‚Äôs actually been very fascinating (despite the several hundred collective
man-hours of work) to see the inside work going on in preparing for an event for some of the field‚Äôs best academics, industry
researchers, and up-and-comers to come and brag about their past months‚Äô or even years‚Äô work. Plus, let‚Äôs be honest: I‚Äôm an
undergrad who has had one year of math and physics and has just started working in a electrical engineering graduate research
lab ‚Äì I was feeling completely out of my element, and it has been a nice break to turn my attention to planning and organizing,
which is something I do rather well.</p>

<p>So, what sort of things go into organizing a conference?</p>

<p>Uh, well, mostly printing things and then arranging them into neat piles. Lots and lots of printing‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ and spreadsheets‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ and of course, the last-minute-rescheduling emails:</p>

<p>Which were not always so polite, thanks to the pressures of planning, lack of sleep, and, in some cases, mad last second scrambling
to get better data plots ‚Äì but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs some unwritten grad student rule somewhere that what happens during
conference week stays in conference week.</p>

<p>But the job also has its perks, like these extra bottles of wine that mysteriously made their way to our table during the banquet,
after it was made known to the catering staff which table was the volunteers‚Äô table.</p>

<p>They also fed us exceedingly well:</p>

<p>And, because this is my web site, I‚Äôm also going to show off these arm badges I made for the volunteers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2016/ivnc-arm-badge.jpg" alt="Picture of arm badge" />
<span class="caption">Made with felt and magic.</span></p>

<p>You see, we needed some way to make the volunteers visible, but nobody wanted to wear t-shirts, which would probably get pretty
stinky if we had to wear them all week in the middle of July, anyway, and I nixed the idea of hats, so the best idea I could think
of was armbands, but I was having a difficult time finding a place to get custom armbands on short notice, and after trying a few
different avenues I realised that it would probably actually be less work to just buy some felt and sew them myself than to source
them, and so I did.</p>

<p>The best part was making a bunch of fancypants physics researchers exclaim in amazement as though I had performed magic.</p>

<p>No wait, the best part was one of the leading academics in the field telling me that this was the best team of volunteers at any
conference he‚Äôd ever attended.</p>

<p>No‚Ä¶ no, wait, the real best part was getting to attend a conference as a first year undergrad at all, but that really deserves
a whole post of its own.</p>
