  <h1 class="title">Who is Lise?</h1>
  
  <div class="divider"></div>
  
  <p>I began my undergraduate career as a literature major, then made a <span class="tiny">tiny</span> change in direction and
  decided to pursue <a href="http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">Engineering Physics</a> at the University of British Columbia, where I
  have just started second year studies.</p>
  
  <p>Why Engineering Physics? I initially chose to study literature because I identified with the artistic values of originality
  and self-expression, and believed that these values could only be satisfied by studying humanities. But, what is more
  expressive than seeing an <a href="/assets/images/2016/headboard-sketch.jpg">unfulfilled niche</a>
  in the world, <a href="/assets/images/2016/headboard-uno-block.jpg">dreaming up a device</a> that fills it, and
  <a href="https://youtu.be/MBOkNSHl62o">bringing it into reality</a>?
  I switched to Engineering Physics because I want to learn to apply my creativity to the tangible world.</p>
  
  <p>You can connect with me online via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsava">LinkedIn</a> or write to me at

  Offline, you are most likely to find me studying for class, working with my teammates on
  <a href="https://ubcsailbot.org/">Sailbot</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8">picking up heavy things</a>.
