  <h1 class="title">Who is Lise?</h1>
  
  <div class="divider"></div>
  
  <p>I began my undergraduate career as a literature major, then made a <span class="tiny">tiny</span> change in direction and
  decided to pursue <a href="http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">Engineering Physics</a> at the University of British Columbia, where I
  have just started second year studies.</p>
  
  <p>Why Engineering Physics? I initially chose to study literature because I identified with the artistic values of originality
  and self-expression, and believed that these values could only be satisfied by studying humanities. But, what is more
  expressive than seeing an unfulfilled niche in the world, dreaming up a device or app that fills it, and bringing it into reality?
  I switched to Engineering Physics because I want to learn to apply my creativity to the tangible world.</p>
  
  <p>You can connect with me online via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsava">LinkedIn</a> or write to me at
  <script>printEmail();</script><noscript>lise at my domain</noscript>.
  Offline, you are most likely to find me studying for class, wrapping up the last of my
  <a href="/wakeup/">summer projects</a>, or 
  <a href="https://youtu.be/jkYpXnZ2uf8">picking up heavy things and then putting them back down</a>.</p>
