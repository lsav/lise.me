  <div class="divider"></div>
  
  <p>I began my undergraduate career as a literature major, then made a <span class="tiny">tiny</span> change in direction and
  decided to pursue <a href="http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">Engineering Physics</a> at the University of British Columbia, where I
  will be starting second year studies in September 2016.</p>
  
  <p>Why Engineering Physics? I initially chose to study literature because I identified with the artistic values of originality
  and self-expression, and believed that these values could only be satisfied by studying “something artistic.” But, what is more
  expressive than seeing an unfulfilled niche in the world, dreaming up a device that fills it, and bringing it into reality?
  I switched to Engineering Physics because I want to learn to apply my creativity to the physical world.</p>
  
  <p>You can connect with me online via <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/lsava">LinkedIn</a> or write to me at lise at my domain.
  Offline, you are likely to find me these days working with the
  <a href="http://nanostructure.ece.ubc.ca/">Nanostructures Research Group</a> at UBC, lifting weights, or otherwise enjoying
  the last days of summer.</p>
